# OWASP ZAP Demo: Legal Website Scanning for GitHub Portfolio

## Project Goal

This project demonstrates how to safely and legally scan a website using OWASP ZAP on macOS for educational purposes. The goal is to create a clear project showcasing my basic cybersecurity skills. It simulates a realistic penetration testing workflow using a proxy-based scanner, giving me hands-on experience with:
Configuring proxy settings in browsers
Monitoring and intercepting HTTP traffic
Performing active vulnerability scans
Reviewing findings such as XSS and SQLi
Generating detailed HTML security reports
This project is ideal for demonstrating an understanding of web application security tools, ethical boundaries, and common security flaws to potential employers.

## Legal Target Website for Scanning

You can only scan websites that explicitly allow security testing.

### Recommended Target:

**[http://testphp.vulnweb.com](http://testphp.vulnweb.com)**

* Provided by Acunetix
* Intentionally vulnerable
* Fully legal to scan

**Important:** Never scan real-world or commercial websites without written permission. Use only official test environments.

## Tools Used

* OWASP ZAP for macOS
* Google Chrome or Firefox
* FoxyProxy (optional)
* GitHub

---

## Step-by-Step:  ZAP Scanning Demo

### 1. Install OWASP ZAP

* Download from [https://www.zaproxy.org/download/](https://www.zaproxy.org/download/)
* Choose the macOS (Apple Silicon) version
* Drag it to Applications and launch it

### 2. Start New ZAP Session

* Open ZAP
* Select "Start a new session"
* Leave default options and click OK

### 3. Set Up Browser Proxy (Chrome example)

* Open Chrome → Settings → Advanced → System → Open Proxy Settings
* Set HTTP proxy to:

  * Host: 127.0.0.1
  * Port: 9090 or 8080 (or match the port in ZAP: Tools → Options → Local Proxies)

Tip: Use the FoxyProxy extension for easy proxy switching.

### 4. Visit Target Site via Proxy

* In the browser (with proxy ON), go to [http://testphp.vulnweb.com](http://testphp.vulnweb.com)
* ZAP should display the site in the "Sites" tab

### 5. Launch Active Scan

* Right-click on `http://testphp.vulnweb.com` in ZAP
* Select: Attack → Active Scan
* Leave default settings, then Start Scan

### 6. View Results

* Track progress in the Active Scan tab
* Review vulnerabilities and recommendations

### 7. Export the Report

* Go to: Report → Generate HTML Report
* Save the report as `zap_report.html`

### 8. (Optional) Manual Payload Test Example

Test fields with the input: `"><script>alert(1)</script>`

* This is a classic XSS test string used to simulate JavaScript injection
* Use only in controlled environments like this test site

# OWASP ZAP Active Scan – Legal Demo Project

## Overview
This demo shows how to use OWASP ZAP to perform a legal security scan against a vulnerable test website.

## Target Website
http://testphp.vulnweb.com (provided by Acunetix)

## Tools Used
- OWASP ZAP (macOS)
- Chrome + Proxy


## Steps Performed
1. Launched ZAP
2. Configured browser proxy (127.0.0.1:9090)
3. Visited test site through proxy
4. Started Active Scan
5. Saved HTML report

## Ethics
This scan was performed only on a legally authorized, intentionally vulnerable test site.

## Report
See `zap_report.html` in this repository.
